# ðŸŽµ Spotify payfully test ðŸŽµ 

The application was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and you can see the app runs [**here**](https://payfully-spotify-test.herokuapp.com/).

This application has 3 views:
- **Login**: Allows the user login with the spotify platform.
- **Search**: Allows the user search tracks using the spotify API.
- **TrackInfo**: Allows the user read the track information.

The application uses the spotify API. For allow the user interact with the sporify api, first of all we need to create an oauth server to allow the user login with the platform. [This Oauth server](https://payfully-spotify-api-test.herokuapp.com/) was created with node and its specific task is authenticate the user with spotify using the next flow:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
User ->> Web: GET: /Login
Web ->> OAuthServer: GET: /Login
OAuthServer ->> User: Redirect to spotify auth
User ->> Spotify: POST: /Login
Spotify ->> OAuthServer: GET /callback
OAuthServer ->> Web: Get /Login?accessToken?xxxx
Web ->> User: Redirect to /search 
```
